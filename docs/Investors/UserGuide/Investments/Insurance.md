# Insurance

Insure your investments against fund losses. To apply for insurance, you need to stake ***10%*** of the desired insurance amount in **DEXE** token (but not less than **100** **DEXE**). You can cancel the insurance at any time by withdrawing **DEXE** tokens from staking.

‚ùó Depositing funds into the insurance pool does not guarantee payment, but only allows the user to participate in the compensation. The decision to provide compensation is made through voting by **DeXe DAO** members.
