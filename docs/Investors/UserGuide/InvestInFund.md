# Investing in the funds

If the user wants to invest in an existing fund, the first step is to select the desired fund. To review the list of all funds, use the `Traders` page.

On the fund page, the user can review its statistic, description, and participants. To invest in the fund, the user needs to buy the token of the fund (**LP**-token) using the **base** token. The owner of **LP**-tokens (fund member) can view the positions of the pool in the `Fund positions` panel.

‚ùó If there are some open positions in the fund, the investor's **base** tokens will be automatically exchanged proportionally to open positions.

If the fund trades in profit, the investor will be able to close his positions in the pool by selling **LP**-tokens and receiving increased amounts of the **base** tokens. Similarly, if the fund loses **base** tokens when trading, the investor will receive fewer tokens when leaving the fund (selling **LP**-tokens).

To buy **LP**-tokens, a standard token-exchange interface is used.
