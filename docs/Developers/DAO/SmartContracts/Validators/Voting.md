# ðŸ—³ Voting

Validators in the **DAO** pool may be needed in order to validate incoming proposals after they have been confirmed by the community. Validators are chosen by the community by assigning them special non-trasferable tokens.

The validator contract is like a DAO pool where validators vote for ***external*** proposals (which came from the **DAO** pool using the ***`moveProposalToValidators()`*** method, see ***GovPools/ExecutingProposals***) and for ***internal***.


Function ***`vote()`*** on `GovValidators` is used by validators for voting.

```solidity
function vote(
    uint256 proposalId,
    uint256 amount, 
    bool isInternal
) external onlyValidator;
```
- ***proposalId*** - proposal ID (***internal*** or ***external***)
- ***amount*** - amount of tokens to vote
- ***isInternal*** - 
    - `true` **->** vote in ***internal*** proposal
    - `false` **->** vote in ***external*** proposal
