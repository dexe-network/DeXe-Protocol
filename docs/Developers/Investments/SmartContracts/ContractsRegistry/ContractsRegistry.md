# üìÉ ContractsRegistry

Function ***`injectDependencies()`*** injects the dependencies into the given contract.

```solidity
 function injectDependencies(string calldata name) external onlyOwner
 ```
- ***name*** - the name of the contract

#
Function ***`upgradeContract()`*** used to upgrade added proxy contract with a new implementation.
```solidity
function upgradeContract(string calldata name, address newImplementation) external onlyOwner
```
- ***name*** - the name of the proxy contract
- ***newImplementation*** - the new implementation the proxy should be upgraded to

‚ùó It is the **Owner's** responsibility to ensure the compatibility between implementations

#
Function ***`upgradeContractAndCall()`*** is used to upgrade added proxy contract with a new implementation, providing data.

```solidity
function upgradeContractAndCall(
    string calldata name,
    address newImplementation,
    bytes calldata data
) external onlyOwner
```
- ***name*** - the name of the proxy contract
- ***newImplementation*** - the new implementation the proxy should be upgraded to
- ***data*** - the data that the new implementation will be called with. This can be an **ABI** encoded function call

‚ùó It is the **Owner's** responsibility to ensure the compatibility between implementations

#
Function ***`addContract()`*** adds pure contracts to the `ContractsRegistry`. These should either be the contracts the system does not have direct upgradeability control over, or the contracts that are not upgradeable.

```solidity
function addContract(string calldata name, address contractAddress) external onlyOwner
```
- ***name*** - the name to associate the contract with
- ***contractAddress*** - the address of the contract

#
Function ***`addProxyContract()`*** is used to add the contracts and deploy the proxy above them. It should be used to add contract that the `ContractsRegistry` should be able to upgrade.
```solidity
function addProxyContract(string calldata name, address contractAddress) external onlyOwner
```
- ***name*** - the name to associate the contract with
- ***contractAddress*** - the address of the implementation

#
Function adds the already deployed proxy to the `ContractsRegistry`. This might be used when the system migrates to a new `ContractRegistry`. This means that the new `ProxyUpgrader` must have the credentials to upgrade the added proxies.

```solidity
function justAddProxyContract(
    string calldata name,
    address contractAddress
) external onlyOwner
```
- ***name*** - the name to associate the contract with
- ***contractAddress*** - the address of the proxy

#
Function ***`removeContract()`*** is used to remove the contract from the `ContractsRegistry`

```solidity
function removeContract(string calldata name) external onlyOwner
```
- ***name*** - the associated name with the contract
