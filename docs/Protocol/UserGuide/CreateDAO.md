The next step is configuring **DAO pool** profile. User need to input name and logo of pool. If no logo image uploaded, the **DeXe** logo will be used.

For governance, user can choose any **ERC-20** token, any **ERC-171** **NFT**, or hybrid of both. Token creation guidence located in `UserGuide/CreateToken`.

## DAO validator settings

On this page, the user can designate trusted **DAO** members to serve as validators, who will hold a validator-only second vote on every passed proposal to filter out potentially malicious proposals. Validators vote using a separate token that can be created and distributed here. 

❗ Once the pool is created, validator settings can be modified only by validator voting.

***Duration of voting*** - time limit for the validators to vote on a validator proposal.

***Quorum required for a vote to pass*** - % of validator tokens that must vote for the voting decision to get passed.


## Voting settings

On this page user can configure the settings for proposals, voting, vote delegation, rewards for activity in **DAO**.

***Vote delegation*** is useful if some member of the **DAO** does not want to vote for proposals on his own. This user can delegate part of his funds to another user and receive rewards.

## Changing general voting settings

While creating **DAO** user can configure changing general voting settings. For example, it can be used to set up higher barrier for proposals that change general voting settings to avoid abuse and to be voted on by only large token holders (user can set the minimum voting threshold to a higher level than in general voting settings).
