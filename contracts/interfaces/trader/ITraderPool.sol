/**
 * The TraderPool contract is a central business logic contract the DEXE platform is built around. The TraderPool represents
 * a collective pool where investors share its funds and the ownership. The share is represented with the LP tokens and the
 * income is made through the trader's activity. The pool itself is tidily integrated with the UniswapV2 protocol and the trader
 * is allowed to trade with the tokens in this pool. Several safety mechanisms are implemented here: Active Portfolio, Trader Leverage,
 * Proposals, Commissions horizon and simplified onchain PathFinder that protect the user funds
